MYWEBSITE CONSTRUCTION GUIDE
===========================

1) OVERVIEW
-----------
This project is a static website with content managed in JSON and rendered into HTML pages.
It has:
- Public pages for visitors (`index.html`, `about.html`)
- An internal data editor view (`data-view.html`)
- Supporting JavaScript modules for dynamic UI pieces
- A build step that pre-renders SEO content into final HTML files

Main goal of the current architecture:
- Keep content editable in one place (`content.json`)
- Keep public pages SEO-friendly by shipping populated HTML


2) HIGH-LEVEL FLOW
------------------
Authoring flow:
1. Update `content.json` (directly or via `data-view.html` table UI)
2. Run `node build/generate-pages.js`
3. Script populates `index.html` and `about.html` from template files
4. Script updates `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
5. Deploy/push to GitHub Pages

Runtime flow in browser:
- Visitor opens `index.html` or `about.html`
- HTML already contains main page text for SEO
- JS enhances page behavior (animations, tools cards, videos, auth, etc.)


3) SOURCE-OF-TRUTH VS GENERATED FILES
-------------------------------------
Source-of-truth for content:
- `content.json`

Source templates (do not treat as deployed pages):
- `index.template.html`
- `about.template.html`

Generated/deployable public pages:
- `index.html`
- `about.html`

Important:
- If `content.json` changes, regenerate public pages before deploy.
- Keep templates and generated pages in sync through the generator.


4) FILE-BY-FILE GUIDE
---------------------
Core content/build:
- `content.json`
  Central structured content for text, attributes, and page metadata.

- `build/generate-pages.js`
  Build script that:
  - Reads `content.json`
  - Injects values into template HTML by selector/id
  - Writes final `index.html` and `about.html`
  - Generates `sitemap.xml`
  - Generates `robots.txt`

- `index.template.html`
  Homepage template with IDs/placeholders used by content mapping.

- `about.template.html`
  About page template with IDs/placeholders used by content mapping.

Public pages:
- `index.html`
  Generated homepage served to users and crawlers.

- `about.html`
  Generated about page served to users and crawlers.

Admin/content tools:
- `data-view.html`
  Internal tabular content editor/viewer for `content.json`.
  Includes `noindex,nofollow` meta to avoid search indexing.

Common UI/behavior scripts:
- `content.js`
  Runtime content-injection script from `content.json`.
  Still present for consistency/fallback and dynamic updates.

- `script.js`
  Shared UI logic (footer year, reveal animation, stats counter).

- `tools.js`
  Loads tools section cards from `content.json` and manages flip behavior.

- `about-communication.js`
  Builds communication carousel/cards for About page from `content.json`.

- `customer.js`
  Renders customer success cards (currently from in-file array).

- `videos.js`
  Renders video cards and modal playback from in-file list.

Auth/security-related UI:
- `auth.js`
  MSAL login/logout handling and user menu visibility.

Styling/assets:
- `styles.css`
  Global styling used by major pages.

- `assets/images/*`
  Logos, avatars, and other image assets.

SEO/crawling files:
- `sitemap.xml`
  Generated sitemap submitted to search engines.

- `robots.txt`
  Crawl directives and sitemap location.

Project docs/config:
- `README.md`
  Setup and deployment instructions, including SEO build command.

- `CNAME`
  Custom domain mapping for GitHub Pages.


5) HOW FILES CONNECT TO EACH OTHER
----------------------------------
- `content.json` -> consumed by:
  - `build/generate-pages.js` during build
  - `content.js`, `tools.js`, `about-communication.js` at runtime

- `index.template.html` + `about.template.html` -> transformed by:
  - `build/generate-pages.js` -> output `index.html`, `about.html`

- `index.html` includes scripts:
  - `content.js`, `tools.js`, `customer.js`, `videos.js`, `script.js`, `auth.js`

- `about.html` includes scripts:
  - `content.js`, `about-communication.js`, `script.js`

- `data-view.html` fetches:
  - `content.json` for editable rows
  - `index.html` and `about.html` to map selectors to page links


6) SEO CONSTRUCTION NOTES
-------------------------
Implemented SEO decisions:
- Main content is present in server-delivered/generated HTML
- Page titles and descriptions are pre-rendered
- Sitemap and robots files exist
- Editor page is marked noindex

Why this matters:
- Search engines can index meaningful content immediately
- Avoids reliance on JS rendering for critical page text

Recommended ongoing SEO practice:
1. Use unique titles/meta for each page
2. Add dedicated case study pages with specific outcomes
3. Add internal links between related sections/pages
4. Keep content updated and publish regularly
5. Submit sitemap in Google Search Console


7) DEPLOYMENT CONSTRUCTION
--------------------------
Current deployment target:
- GitHub Pages (via `main` branch)

Safe release checklist:
1. Edit `content.json`
2. Run `node build/generate-pages.js`
3. Verify generated `index.html` and `about.html`
4. Commit templates/content/build outputs together
5. Push to `main`
6. Confirm sitemap URL is reachable


8) IMPORTANT MAINTENANCE RULES
------------------------------
- Do not edit generated page content manually in `index.html`/`about.html` as primary workflow.
- Prefer editing `content.json` then regenerating.
- If IDs/selectors change in templates, update JSON mapping accordingly.
- Keep domain in `build/generate-pages.js` accurate for sitemap.
- Keep editor (`data-view.html`) internal and not linked publicly in primary navigation.


9) FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (OPTIONAL)
---------------------------------
- Add GitHub Action to auto-run build on every push
- Move `customer.js` and `videos.js` data into JSON for single-source content management
- Add schema markup (Organization, Service, Article/CaseStudy)
- Create separate generated case study pages and include them in sitemap
